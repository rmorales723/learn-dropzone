This project is a simple web app, which includes the dropzone and input, which allows the user to enter text and drag and drop multiple files to the dropzone. It will then upload to the storage, and will allow the user to upload the images file...if the user trys to input a different type file, it will not allow it, and the border of the dropzone will turn red.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

The 'DropZone' is located at the left of the screen. Where the user drags the file, and drops. Adds a caption, and presses 'post' where it`s stored to the database 'FireBase' and rendered to the browser in the center of the screen..
