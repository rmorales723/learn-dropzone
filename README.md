This project is a simple web app, which includes the dropzone and input, which allows the user to enter text and drag and drop multiple files to the dropzone. It will then upload to the storage, and will allow the user to upload the images file...if the user trys to input a different type file, it will not allow, and the border of the dropzone will turn red.

```bash
